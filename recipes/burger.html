            <h2>what makes burger tasty?</h2>
            <p>The best burgers offer a combination of tastes and textures – sweet, sour, salt – with a bit of crunch. 
                The patty needs to be juicy, the bun soft but sturdy, and 
                you want the meat/bun/accompaniment ratio to be even from first to last bite.</p>
                <h3>INGRIDIENTS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, softend</li>
                    <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
                    <li>8 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Butter each half of hamburger buns.

                    </li>
                    <li>Place bacon in a heavy skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Set the skillet aside, reserving grease.</li>

                    <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until preferred doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Top each burger with 2 slices bacon and a Cheddar cheese slice; close the grill lid until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
                         Remove patties from the grill.</li>
                         <li>Place buns on the grill, buttered-side down, and cook until browned, about 1 minute. Remove from the grill. Place 1 patty on the bottom half of each bun.

                        </li>
                        <li>Reheat the bacon grease in the skillet over medium-high heat.
                             Crack eggs into the hot skillet and fry until whites are cooked but yolk is still runny, about 4 minutes. Immediately place 1 egg on top of each patty. Top with lettuce, onion, avocado, and remaining buns.
